# 2026-BuildSeason-1498

Code for Team 1498's 2026 robot, Aurora Zwei.

## Planned Subsystems

### Drivetrain
01/17/26 - CTRE Swerve Template generated.  The robot still needs to b driven on the ground to determine gains.
01/17/26 - Added the PathPlanner base code into the drive subsystem.  Still need to add auton selection code, running the auton command in RobotContainer, and driving to a set position during TeleOp.

### Vision
The Limelight will be used to supplement the pose estimate.

### LED
Every year, the team wants to add LEDs to the robot for signalling, but it's always a low priority. <br>
Maybe this year will be the year.

### Intake
An intake for picking up game pieces. <br>
Through bumper? Over the bumper? We'll find out.

### Hopper
Some system for agitating the game pieces and moving them up into the shooter.

### Shooter
A shooter that includes a turret, hood adjuster, and flywheel. <br>
Maybe more (definitely more), but this is just a draft...

### Climber
Probably some kind of hook or clamp to latch on the climb bars.
